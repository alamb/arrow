/// Macro used to define a function group for the benchmark harness; see the
/// `bench_main!` macro for more details.
///
/// This is used to define a function group; a collection of functions to call with common
/// Criterion configurations adapted for multiple measurements.
///
/// Accepts two forms which can be seen below.
///
/// Note that the group name given here is not important, it must simply
/// be unique.
/// Note also that this macro is not related to the `Criterion::benchmark_group` function or the
/// `BenchmarkGroup` type.
///
/// # Examples:
///
/// Complete form:
///
/// ```
/// # use bench_helper::*;
/// # fn bench_method1<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn bench_method2<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
/// #
/// bench_group!{
///     name = benches;
///     // NOTE: This will have its measurement adjusted while running the suite
///     config = Criterion::default();
///     targets = bench_method1, bench_method2
/// }
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// In this form, all of the options are clearly spelled out. This expands to
/// a function named benches, which uses the given config expression to create
/// an instance of the Criterion struct. This is then passed by mutable
/// reference to the targets.
///
/// Compact Form:
///
/// ```
/// # use bench_helper::*;
/// # fn bench_method1<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn bench_method2<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
/// #
/// bench_group!(benches, bench_method1, bench_method2);
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
/// In this form, the first parameter is the name of the group and subsequent
/// parameters are the target methods. The Criterion struct will be created using
/// the `Criterion::default()` function. If you wish to customize the
/// configuration, use the complete form and provide your own configuration
/// function.

/// Macro which expands to a benchmark harness.
///
/// Currently, using Criterion.rs requires disabling the benchmark harness
/// generated automatically by rustc. This can be done like so:
///
/// We expand on criterion and allow for capturing multiple interesting measurements.
///
/// ```toml
/// [[bench]]
/// name = "my_bench"
/// harness = false
/// ```
///
/// In this case, `my_bench` must be a rust file inside the 'benches' directory,
/// like so:
///
/// `benches/my_bench.rs`
///
/// Since we've disabled the default benchmark harness, we need to add our own:
///
/// ```ignore
/// # use bench_helper::*;
/// # fn bench_method1<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn bench_method2<M: Measurement>(measure_name: &str, c: &mut Criterion<M>) {
/// # }
///
/// bench_group!(benches, bench_method1, bench_method2);
/// bench_main!(benches);
/// ```
///
/// The `bench_main` macro expands to a `main` function which runs all of the
/// benchmarks in the given groups. For the following measurements:
///
/// * Wall time
/// * Cache misses (Optional as recorded by linux perf)
/// * Branch misses (Optional as recorded by linux perf)
/// * Normalised CPU Cycles (Optional as recorded by linux perf)
/// * Allocation rate
/// * Reallocation rate
///
/// This macro can be altered to add extra stats if needed
